1) Basic file exploit

wget the file
open the file in a text editor
after going through the C code we realize that the 'flag' will be shown if we give a string as the input for the second case
we then connect to the program with netcat and then press 1 and enter a random string and random length of the string to store it in the database
then we press 2 to go to the second case for accessing the contents in the database
we then enter a random string instead of number and we get the flag displayed

2)Buffer Overflow0
wget the files in the problem
we see that the file is not executable so we make it one using chmod +x command
after that we open the code and see that the code uses a get() function which is not used for security purpose
the geá¹­s() function stores the characters past the buffer limit. We see that max 16 bytes of data can
be used fro input
Using this information when connect to the netcat server and input something beyond 16 bytes we get the flag

3) CVE

4)RPS
wget the file and open in text editor
by observing the winning condition as stated in the hint we see that it is a substring of the
rockpaperscissors string in the program in strstr statement which checks substring of string 2 in string  1
we then connect to the server to play and every time we play rockpaperscissors and get the flag
