Cryptography
1)MOD26- the flag given is a caesear cipher in which all the characters are shifted by 13 positions

2)transposition trial

with open("message.txt") as filp:
     contents = flip.read()
     
for i in range(0,len(contents),3):
    chunk = contents[i,i+3]
    
    a,b,c=chunk
    print(c+a+b, end="")
we observe that all the words are shifted by 3 positions so we print the flag in chunks of 3
then to decode the flag we assign a b c to h e T that is a holder place for all the chunks
we then print how things were rearranged that is (c a b)
