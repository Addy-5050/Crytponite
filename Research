A Lightweight Chaos-Based Medical Image Encryption Scheme Using Random Shuffling and XOR Operations
Masood et al. suggested a light-weight, highly secure encryption method for medical images in this study that is based on the Henon chaotic map, Brownian motion, and Chen's chaotic system. 
In the suggested system, diffusion is obtained using Brownian motion and Chen's chaotic map, while confusion is obtained using a two-dimensional Henon chaotic map.
The outcomes of the experiments demonstrate that the suggested cryptosystem is a lightweight strategy that needs fewer computational resources and can reach the acceptable security level for encrypting medical images.


Novel Medical Image Encryption Scheme Based on Chaos and DNA Encoding
Belazi et al. suggested a new chaos-based medical picture encryption system to circumvent the use of just pixel-based substitution and bit-level replacement while using cascade for image encryption.
Two iterative phases make up the cryptosystem, which is preceded by a key creation layer that uses the SHA-256 hash function. The block-based permutations, pixel-based substitutions, DNA encoding, bit-level substitutions, DNA decoding, and bit-level diffusion make up each phase of the encrypted system. While the sine-Chebyshev map is used for the key stream in bit level diffusion, the logistic-Chebyshev map generates the key streams in bit level substitution.
Computer simulations and security assessments both support the idea's suitability as a defence against various types of assaults. The potential for real-time and secure picture applications is high given its low complexity.

A sophisticated chaos-based PRNG is intended to produce an encryption key of excellent quality. The created key exhibits great levels of complexity, entropy, and randomness. For the image encryption, a better design based on the confusion and diffusion properties is suggested. To create the encrypted images, the image goes through a processing cycle that consists of four operations: random permutations of the position pixel, position permutations of the pixel's bits, S-box pixel substitution, and XOR diffusion.
To fulfil real-time demands, the algorithm can fully utilise parallelism and pipeline execution in hardware implementation. Since the PRNG passed the NIST 800-22 test suit, it can be used for secure image encryption. It offers a lot of key space that is resistant to brute force attacks.
