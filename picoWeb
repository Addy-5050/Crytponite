1) Includes
go to the website and right click to view page source
afetr that click on the css and javascript codes for the flags

2) Inspect HTML
go to the website and right click to view page source
we can see the flag

3)Local Authority
go to the website and right click to inspect the web page
enter any login details and hit enter
when we click the sources tab we see a javascript when we open it we can see the login details
then we enter the true login details and get the flag

4) Search Source

5)Forbidden Path

6) Power Cookie
go to the website and click the continue as guest button
open the developer tools and go to the applications in that we can see the cookies option
we need to modify the cookie value to 1  making the value to true to indicate that we are the admin and thus giving us the flag

7) Secrets

8) scavenger Hunt
When we inspect the file we find the first part of the flag in html file
The css gives us the second part of the flag
In the javascript we find a hint to keep the page from indexing
We put a robots.txt in front of the url which denotes not to index the the page and we get the flag
We also get the next step for getting the flag that is to access an apache server
We do this by adding the extension .htaccess in front of url and we get teh next part of the flag
We get another step fort he flag and that tells us to access a hidden file for that we use
DS_Store which keeps a track of whats goin with the file system and we get the file

9) Cookies
We got the link and inspect the page and go to the cookies section
when we put the name of the example cookie we get the value as 1 for the cookie
we can also edit those values and weedit the value to 2 and reload the page
we get name of another cookie
by editing the values we get the flag at value 18

10)Logon
We go the page and type in joe as the username and a random password
we successfully login but we dont get the flag
on inspecting the cookies we see the value of password as false, we edit this value to true andd
reload the file and we get the flag

11) Login
We inspect the page and we find css and java scripts
we analyse the java by first formatting the code in vstudio as it was all in single line
we then see the ternary operations for username and password. We also see that it is in base64 format
because of the 'btoa' function which converts into base64
we take both the username and password and put it a online base64 converter and we get the username and password
in ascii. We put in the correct details and get teh flag

12) Dont use client side
We inspect the webpage and look throught the javascript and we find number of nested ifs
we simply go substring wise according to the conditions and form the flag

13) Some assembly required
Web Assembly(Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack based virtual machine it is designed
to be portable compliation target for programming Languages
When we go to the website and inspect the wasm file we find the flag in it

14) Caas
We open the website and write a random message in the given url on the webpage
There is nothing we get on inspecting the current page
We download the given file in the problem and analyze the given code
We find that there is GET method and see that the line /cowsay/:message line
which basically grabs the next element as a message
We set up a proxy using burp and look at the request
We see message 'abc' is passed to the path and we want to add another command to it so we send it to reapeater
We edit the GET method line and give the command
GET /cowsay/abc;ls; HTTP/1.1 which basically lists out all the files as in command line
Then we modify the command to:
GET /cowsay/abc;cat%20falg.txt; HTTP/1.1
we use %20 as we cannot use space in a URL so %20 is the URL equivalent of a space
We get the flag when we execute the command

15) GET aHEAD
We open the browser using burp as mentioned in hint and set up a proxy
We the send some traffic and analyse them
we notice we get a GET method and a POST method
we send them both to the repeater and make some changes in both of them
We change first in GET method instead of GET we type HEAD and then send it to the browser
we get the flag
HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of GET request but without the response body

16) Some assembly required 2
we go to the file and observe that there is a JS file and WASM (Web Assembly)
and see the check flag condition in wasm file
what is happening in the file is that the flag is getting XORed with 8 before beiing saved.
We see that check flag function uses compare to comapre the strings
xakgK\5cNs((j:l9<mimk?:k;9;8=8?=0?>jnn:j=lu\00\00
we XOR this with 8 and get the flag

17) Roboto Sans
Website owners use the /robots.txt file to give the instructions about their site to web robots; this 
is called The Robots Exclusion Protocol

Since the challenge is named Roboto sans it made sense to check the robots.txt extension of the site
we see some information like this
User-agent *
Disallow: /cgi-bin/
Think you have seen your flag or want to keep looking.

ZmxhZzEudHh0;anMvbXlmaW
anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==
svssshjweuiwl;oiho.bsvdaslejg
Disallow: /wp-admin/

looking at the == sign it gives us the idea that maybe a base64 format and when we decode it
we get js/myfile
we add this to the url and we get our flag


18) SQL Direct
We first launch the instance and then get the server details and password and we login using them
we then go through the help command 
\? for psql command help
we use \d to list the tables
we then write 
select * from flags; to give all the contents inside the flag entry
we then get the flag

19)Pico Browser
What is User Agent? 
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/109.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
This is my user agent
This page shows us what my web browser is sending in the "User Agent" header for my HTTP requests
This means it tells us where you are coming from what browser am I using
This Header can be manipulated or modified or spoof it
https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-user-agent/

curl is a command line tool that helps to transfer data to or from a server using any of the 
supported protocols 
for the challenge we basically need to modify our user agent name
 curl "https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50522/"
 gives us the content of the URL on the terminal
 to modify the user agent we do
 curl "https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50522/" -H "User Agent: picobrowser"
 
 we then get the flag in the contents of the URL
 -H helps in providing our new header
 
 20) client-side-again
 what is obfuscation- it means to make something difficult to understand. A code is obfuscated
 to protect intellectual property and to prevent an attacker from reverse engineering a code
 
 when we analyse the website we find a javascript which has a obfuscated line
 we can pretty print that line to analyse further
 we find this line
    var _0x5a46 = ['0a029}', '_again_5', 'this', 'Password\x20Verified', 'Incorrect\x20password', 'getElementById', 'value', 'substring', 'picoCTF{', 'not_this'];
and we can make out the flag from this line
picoCTF{not_this_again_50a029}

21) It is my birthday
What is hash function- it is any function that can be used to map data of any length to a fixed length
we need to give a two diiferent files whose MD5 hash values are same to cause a collision 
we use md5 cause it has possibility of collision
we can find two diiferernt files that generate same md5 hash on internet 
after downloading those files I changed their extension to pdf and submitted them
it opens a source code and we can find the flag

22) Who Are You?(should be worth atleast 200 points)
When we go to the site it said that only people using PicoBrowser are accepted
we can change the header using curl, but i used a chrome extension that allowed to change the headers
1) User-Agent - PicoBrowser
after refreshing the page it said  that he does not like users form another site so we have to change the 'Referer' and give the original URL
2) Referer - http://mercury.picoctf.net:1270/
After he said that the site was only active in 2018 so we change the Date header
3) Date - Sat, 23 Dec 2018 07:28:00 GMT
After that he said that he does not like being tracked so we have to change the DNT header(do not track)
4) DNT - 1
after that he said that users Sweden are allowed so we have to change the IP address 
5) X-Forwarded-For - 103.57.72.0 (Sweden IP address from net)
after that he wants to see if we know swedish so we have to change the language to swedish
6) Accept-Language - sv
we get the flag on the site

23)JaWT
JSON Web Token(JWT) is an open standard that defines a compact and self contained way for securely
transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signes(key)
JSON Stands for JavaScriptObjectNotation
It is a text format for storing and transporting data

for this challenge we need the password for admin user name as hinted on the JaWT page
Jwt has a header, a payload and a signature(key)
When we give any username and copy the cookie and put it in JWT debugger we can se it decodes the cookie or token
and we can see our username in the payload section 
This also works in reverse if make changes in the payload section like for example i make the user admin
it would provide with an encoded cookie which we can then paste it in the cookies on the website
however we wont be able to access the it gives an 'Internal Server Error' because the signature does not match the payload which we modified

We see there is a link on the site which is github repository of John The Ripper which is an advanced offline password cracker. If the private key is weak
we can use John The Ripper.It basically takes the input and a wordlist and quickly guess and checks

On the terminal
john JAWT --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=HMAC-SHA256

Here JAWT is the file which contains the encoded cookie for the user admin
wordlist is a list of passwords from a site rockyou which contains passwords of the users on the site rockyou after a data breach
--format=HMAC-SHA256 is what type of encryption is used. We know this cause it is there on the JWT website
after this we do
john --show JAWT and it shows ilovepico
"Found" the password in between ilovepinky53..ilovepatrice
meainng it guessed that "ilovepico" worked for the JAWT signature

so now we can fill ilovepico in the signature section of JWT site and we get the cookie and user as admin and we get the encoded cookie.
we take this cookie and paste it and refresh the page we get the flag

24) Irish Name Repo 1
we go to the login page and from the hints we know that we have to use some kind of sql injection
so in password I typed ' OR '1'='1 > the most basic sql injection and user name as admin and we get the flag

25) Irish Name Repo 2
This time the password is being filtered so we can use some sql injection in username section
we can use admin.;-- which comments out the rest of the fields and checks only the username

26) Web Gaunlet
sql injections
when we put a username and password as admin and admin we get the following message
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' AND password='admim'
so for round 1 we can do something like in the username part as admin';-- which basically comments rest everything out
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin';--' we skip the rest

for round 2 
for this we dont to use OR and like =-- we get this idea from filters.php file
so in username we put admin'; (removing --)

for round 3
we get new filters or and = like >  < --
so again we run the same username as before admin';

for round 4
we get new filters or and = like >< -- admin
to bypass this we use a command like 
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='addy'/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/*/**/FROM/**/users/**/LIMIT/**/1;
here /**/ represents a space as we can substitute space
UNION combines two select tables 
we need to selct from users and limit it 1 result as 1 is usually admin

for round 5 
we get new filters this time we cant use UNION also
|| allows for string concatenation we can do adm'||'in
we then refresh the page and get the flag


27) Web Gaunlet 2
On the filters page we can see the following filters 
Filters: or and true false union like = > < ; -- /* */ admin
So we cannot use them
We can again use the concat like in Web Gaunlet1
If we put the following query in username : adm'||'in and pass for password it shows the following
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='adm'||'in'' AND password='pass'

So our password is wrong
we can get rid of the AND password='pass' line by using 'except'
in user name we put  adm'||'in except select  and ,' in password

We basically said except select this "AND password='pass'" constant string and "(,') this constant string
we selected the constant string we are going to take everybody from users wherer the username is admin and we will subtract out if we ever had
a usre name of AND password with an empty password
We get the flag in filter php

28) Most Cookies
Cookies track user activity to save user information in the browser as key value pairs which can be accessed whenever necessary by the developers 
to make a website easier to use
Flask is a lightweight, web development framework built using python.
