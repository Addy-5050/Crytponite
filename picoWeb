8) scavenger Hunt
When we inspect the file we find the first part of the flag in html file
The css gives us the second part of the flag
In the javascript we find a hint to keep the page from indexing
We put a robots.txt in front of the url which denotes not to index the the page and we get the flag
We also get the next step for getting the flag that is to access an apache server
We do this by adding the extension .htaccess in front of url and we get teh next part of the flag

DS_Store which keeps a track of whats goin with the file system and we get the file

We inspect the page and we find css and java scripts
we analyse the java by first formatting the code in vstudio as it was all in single line
we then see the ternary operations for username and password. We also see that it is in base64 format
because of the 'btoa' function which converts into base64
we take both the username and password and put it a online base64 converter and we get the username and password
in ascii. We put in the correct details and get teh flag

12) Dont use client side
We inspect the webpage and look throught the javascript and we find number of nested ifs
